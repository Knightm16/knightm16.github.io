    <div style="background-color:teal;"><p style="font-size: 30;">Playing Minecraft back in early beta, I always lamented the boring world gen and lack of life to all of my builds.
    To help make towns and nations feel alive, I developed a system to fill out settlements with NPCs. This developed into a game, as different villagers needed different requirements, from food, to amenities, to small supply chains.
    Soon the world was becoming more an more populated. I moved the idea to an earth map for more interesting geography, and then began adding new blocks and items to make different parts of Earth feel more unique!</p>

    <p style="font-size:30;">As the server developed, it became a wonderful project, in which those who liked the idea continued to join! If you think this is your kind of game, come join us at the discord link below! </p>
